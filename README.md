# 📊 README —  Global Superstore Order Dashboard (2012–2016)

## 📝 Project Overview

This project explores the Global Superstore dataset to uncover insights behind sales, profit margins, shipping performance, and order priorities. The objective is to provide a clear understanding of how different factors contribute to the overall business performance of the retail chain. Using Tableau, I built four interactive visualizations to deep-dive into the data.



## 📌 Dashboard Visualizations

### 1. Sales by Region
A bar chart visualization brings clarity to the sales performance across different regions. This chart allows users to quickly compare and identify the regions that drive the most revenue.

### 2. Profit Margin by Category
Using a scatter plot, this visualization displays the profit margins across key product categories. By examining which categories yield the highest profitability, businesses can better allocate resources and refine product strategies.

### 3. Shipping Cost Analysis
A line chart tracks the journey of shipping costs over a certain time period. It highlights trends and changes in shipping expenses, helping to pinpoint efficiency improvements or areas of concern within the logistics framework.

### 4. Order Priority Breakdown
A pie chart offers a quick visual breakdown of the order priorities. It helps determine how many orders fall into various categories—such as Standard, Second, First, and Same Day—supporting informed decisions around order fulfillment and customer service operations.
